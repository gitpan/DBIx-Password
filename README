NAME
    DBIx::Password - Allows you to create a global password file for
    DB passwords

SYNOPSIS
      use DBIx::Password;
      my $dbh = DBIx::Password->connect($user);

DESCRIPTION
    Don't you hate keeping track of database passwords and such
    throughout your scripts? How about the problem of changing those
    passwords on a mass scale? This module is one possible solution.
    When you go to build this module it will ask you to create
    virtual users. For each user you need to specify the database
    module to use, the database connect string, the username and the
    password. You will be prompted to give a name to this virtual
    user. You can add as many as you like. I would recommend that if
    you are only using this with web applications that you change
    the final permissions on this package after it is installed in
    site_perl such that only the webserver can read it.

    Once your are done you can use the connect method that comes
    with DBIx-Password and just specify one of the virtual users you
    defined while making the module.

    BTW I learned the bless hack that is used from Apache::DBI so
    some credit should go to the authors of that module. This is a
    rewrite of the module Tangent::DB that I did for slashcode.

    Hope you enjoy it.
